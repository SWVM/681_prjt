# 681_prjt
symbolic execution tool for 681 course prjt

## Documentation
The code should be kinda self documenting, if not, check the commented out test codes and/or the examples.
conda was used for env management, the exported env is in env.yaml. I didnt use too many external packages, two that i explicitly installed are termcolor and z3-solver.
good luck.


The actual implementation is in [./src/SymExec.py](https://github.com/SWVM/681_prjt/blob/main/src/SymExec.py)
